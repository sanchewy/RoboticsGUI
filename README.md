# RoboticsGUI “Make it Move”

For this assignment you need to make the robot controllable with a keyboard. Either plugged in or remotely SSH into the robot and run a Python program that will allow you to control the
robot.

With keys on a keyboard (over SSH to the Pi) you will need to be able to:

1. Drive forward and reverse. 3 speeds in both directions, if the robot tips you are going too fast and should step up and step down the values in a for loop.
2. Turn left or right. Do not tip with the speed.
3. STOP the robot…….get this done early.
a. Be careful, if you stop too fast it will tip the robot.
b. If your program crashes you lose control of the stop function, be prepared to hit the power switch.
4. Twist the upper body left, right and center with thee keys, three steps of resolution.
5. Twist head left, right and center, 5 steps of resolution.
6. Raise and lower the head tilt, 5 degrees of resolution.
7. Fool proof your code.
8. Prepare in advance, Write your code so the controller can take input from a keyboard, network or possibly the touch screen or pre-created text file. Be prepared for any type
of data input.

The Pi boards run a full linux image loaded onto the Micro SD cards.

Here is an image of the robots. Arms were added to all of them for later projects.
