# RoboticsGUI

Each team will need to create your own GUI to program the robot with the touch screen. You will need to be able to give 8 instructions for full credit. You don’t need to use icons like mine, you can just use text, but for full credit it needs to be programmed without a keyboard, just the screen. 

1. Being able to complete my set of commands 40 points, each command you can pull off is 5 points ……. Example: Go forward 5 feet, turn right, go forward 7 feet, stop, look right, look left, turn 90 degrees left, go forward 2 feet, back up 2 feet, twist body full to right……etc. etc.
a. I’ll set up an obstacle course for you to attempt to complete.
2. 30 points is for your GUI look and feel, ease of use and no errors on just using the GUI. There must be a play/start button of some kind that will run through the commands that have been programmed in order. If you don’t get the play working you still can get 30 points for this part, plus the next points for #3 if you can start the animation on the screen. For full credit you must be able to delete and clear programs or pieces of programs the user has developed.
3. 10 points is for an animation you develop while the bot is running the program. It can be whatever makes sense that a user might like, it can be letting the user know where you are in the program, or just something that makes sense…….has to be an animation, and gives your robot a little personality. If it’s good, and you let me, I might use it on stage with the robots.

Note: Because batteries will be different values you can try it a few times to get five feet down to your timing…..but the timing has to be something dynamically input at program time. (Different charge levels go different distances in the same time period).

The Pi boards run a full linux image loaded onto the Micro SD cards.

Here is an image of the robots. Arms were added to all of them for later projects.
